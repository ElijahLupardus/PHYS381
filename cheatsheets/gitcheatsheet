:: BRANCHING AND MERGING ::
 

git init :: makes a repository a git repository

git branch :: displays branches

git branch (argument) :: creates branch

git checkout (argument) :: switches between branches

git checkout -b (argument) :: creates a new branch and moves you to it

git merge (argument) :: copy work from one branch into another (merges the argument branch into the branch you are in)




:: REMOTES ::

git remote :: displays all current remotes (origin is the default name given when a repository is cloned)

git remote -v :: gives more information about remotes

git clone :: make a local copy of a remote repository

Fork (can't be done from the command line) :: makes a remote copy of a remote repository

*fork a remote repository, and then clone it to obtain your own copy*

git remote add upstream (URL of original remote repository on GitHub) :: makes you clone point to the original repository,
	rather than to your forked version of the repository

git push :: send changes to a remote (origin)

git fetch :: get changes from a remote (almost never use)

git pull :: fetch and merge changes from a remote
